# Radar forward operator (operadar)
This radar forward operator is developped by the researchers of the National Centre for Meteorological Research (CNRM).

The software is designed to compute synthetic dual-polarization variables as well as the specific attenuation at orthogonal polarizations in a 3D grid.
It is adapted to read and manipulate AROME and MesoNH model files and currently requires a repository of lookup tables. These tables contain the scattering coefficients to compute the polarimetric variables, either in the Rayleigh or Mie scattering regime (with the T-matrix method). 

<span style='color:DodgerBlue;font-weight:bold'>------- NEW SINCE JUNE 2025 ! -------</span>
<br>OPERADAR software now includes an executable to generate the lookup tables. The scattering coefficients stored in the tables are computed both in the Rayleigh approximation and using the T-matrix method (see [Mishchenko and Travis 1994](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0030401894907315?via%3Dihub)).

### INPUT
* Model file (`.fa` for AROME files or `.nc` for MesoNH)
* Configuration file
* Lookup tables (created beforehand with the table generator executable).
* For colleagues at CNRM, the default configuration of the tables can be found on belenos at `/home/augros/TmatCoefInt_SCXKaW/`

### OUTPUT : netcdf file with
* X/Y grid horizontal coordinates (1D)
* model pressure levels vertical coordinates (1D)
* latitude/longitude fields (2D)
* dual-pol variables : $Z_{H}$ , $Z_{DR}$ , $K_{DP}$ , $\rho_{HV}$ (3D)
* specific attenuation : $A_{H}$ , $A_{v}$ (3D)
* temperature, altitude, contents and concentrations fields (3D)
* dataset attributes such as the horizontal resolution, the options used to compute the mixed-phase or simulate the radar data.

# How to install
The installation of `operadar` should be preferred in a virtual environment. The procedure is detailled [in the Wiki](https://github.com/UMR-CNRM/operadar/wiki/Installation-tutorial).


# How to run
1) To work properly, lookup tables should be generated **before** running `operadar` (unless you have a direct access to the tables).
Steps to create the tables are available in [Generation of the lookup tables](https://github.com/UMR-CNRM/operadar/wiki/Generation-of-the-lookup-tables).<br>*--> If you already have access to the tables, you may skip this step.*
2) A configuration file is red by `operadar` to compute the polarimetric fields, according to your chosen parameterization. See [Simulation configuration](https://github.com/UMR-CNRM/operadar/wiki/Simulation-configuration) for extended explanations.
3) Finally, a shell executable is provided to launch the forward operator for one file at a time. However, `operadar` can be used within other algorithm, to loop on multiple files and eventually with varying configurations over files that share certain common parameters. Explanations are in [Execution of the forward operator](https://github.com/UMR-CNRM/operadar/wiki/Execution-of-the-forward-operator)
